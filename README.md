In this project, me and my two partners implemented a solve method, a constraint check and read from sudoku puzzles.

After mostly using Python and Java throughout college, c# was learned for this project.

We made it efficient enough to solve even difficult puzzles instantly. 

The puzzle names if testing are: s01.txt, s01b.txt, s12a.txt, and s15b.txt.

Here are some examples of the program working:

Any 9x9 puzzle in a txt format like the puzzles above can be solved using this solver.
